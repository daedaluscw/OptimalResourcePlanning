 * 	This code defines the manager of the generic resources. The manager will provide the interface for the 
 * program. The manager will initialize the list of available resources by reading the data form a file. 
 * At the end of the process the manager will update the data file to reflect the changes made. The 
 * manager will handle transactions between the program and the resource list.
